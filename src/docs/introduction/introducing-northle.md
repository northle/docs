# Introducing Northle

Northle (pronounced `/nɑrθl/`) is a modern and declarative backend framework for Node.js. It makes it easy to create fast and secure web applications with awesome developer experience.

::: warning
Northle is currently in the `alpha` stage. Although it is already suitable for creating apps, you may still encounter some bugs and breaking changes.
:::

## Philosophy

Northle provides a strong **architecture** which makes it easier to create highly scalable apps.

The framework uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to provide best developer experience. We believe that this language is the best option for secure Node.js app development. Northle provides:

- [Modular](/docs/basics/modules) HTTP architecture

- Dependency-free [installation](/docs/introduction/getting-started#creating-project) process
