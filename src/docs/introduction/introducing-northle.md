# Introducing Northle

Northle (pronounced `/nɑrθl/`) is a modern, declarative backend development framework for Node.js. It makes it easy to create fast and secure web applications with awesome developer experience.

::: warning
Northle is currently in `alpha` stage. Altough it is already suitable for creating apps, you may encounter some bugs and API breaking changes. The documentation is not complete yet.
:::

## Philosophy

Northle provides a strong **architecture** which allows developers to create highly scalable and easy-to-maintain apps.

This framework uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) as the main language to provide best developer experience. We believe that this language is the best option for Node.js development. With TypeScript you can create secure and bug-free web applications.

Also, we managed to provide a pleasant and dependency-free [installation](/docs/introduction/getting-started#creating-project) process. You don't need to install any global packages and CLIs to create new Northle project.

## Prerequisites

To learn Northle you will need to have a basic knowlege of:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
