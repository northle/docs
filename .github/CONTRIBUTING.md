## Creating Pull Requests

Contributing in this repository is based on GitHub's [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). Before creating a pull request, please read through the following rules:

- Always provide a short description to your pull request. You can also open an [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) before working on it.
- Commit messages must follow a specific convention - they must be short and first letter must be uppercased, for example: `git commit -m "Add feature x"`.
